# Rao Group Website

This is the website of our academic research group at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

This website template was downloaded from Allan lab, and is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. Go to *aboutwebsite.md*  to learn how to copy and modify this page for your purpose.

Just so you don't waste 2 hours like me, you must run on Jekyll with Ruby 2.7 or else the required dependencies in Gemfiles.lock will run into issues with ruby_dev.
